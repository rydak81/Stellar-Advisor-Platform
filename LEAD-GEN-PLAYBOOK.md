## STEP 1: FIND AMAZON BRANDS

### Method A: Amazon Best Sellers (Free, Manual)

**Go to:** amazon.com/Best-Sellers

**Target Categories:**
- Home & Kitchen
- Health & Household
- Beauty & Personal Care
- Sports & Outdoors
- Pet Supplies
- Baby
- Office Products
- Patio, Lawn & Garden

**What to Look For:**
- Brands ranked #20-500 in subcategory (not top 10—they're too big)
- Private label brands (not Nike, Apple, etc.)
- 100-5,000 reviews (established but not massive)
- Products priced $20-100 (healthy margins)
- Brand name on listing (not generic)

**Process:**
1. Go to subcategory (e.g., Home & Kitchen > Kitchen & Dining > Coffee & Espresso > Coffee Makers)
2. Browse page 1-5 of Best Sellers
3. Click on products, note brand name
4. Look for brands that appear multiple times (multiple ASINs = real brand)

**Red Flags (Skip These):**
- Chinese brand names (harder to reach decision maker)
- Major national brands
- No brand name / generic listings
- Suspiciously cheap products

### Method B: Amazon Brand Search (Free, Faster)

**Search Amazon for:**
- "[Category] + [product type]" and filter by brand
- Look at "Brands related to your search"
- Check brand storefronts (amazon.com/stores/[brandname])

**Brand Storefront = Real Brand**
- If they have an Amazon storefront, they're invested
- Storefront shows full product line
- Often links to their website

### Method C: Amazon Brand Analytics Proxies (Free)

**Use these searches to find established brands:**
```
site:amazon.com/stores "shop all"
site:amazon.com "[category]" "our brand"
```

### Method D: Tools (Paid, Faster)

| Tool | What It Does | Cost |
|------|--------------|------|
| **Jungle Scout** | Find brands by revenue estimate | $49/mo |
| **Helium 10** | Brand search + revenue estimates | $79/mo |
| **SmartScout** | Brand database with contacts | $97/mo |
| **SalesSpy** | Brand revenue estimates | Free trial |

**If budget allows:** SmartScout is specifically designed for finding Amazon brands with revenue data and sometimes contact info.

---

## STEP 2: RESEARCH THE BRAND → FIND THE COMPANY

### From Amazon Listing to Company

**On the Amazon Listing:**
1. Click brand name → Goes to brand storefront or search
2. Look for "Visit the [Brand] Store" link
3. Check storefront for website link
4. Check product packaging in images for website

**If No Website on Amazon:**
1. Google: "[Brand Name] + company"
2. Google: "[Brand Name] + founder"
3. Google: "[Brand Name] + Amazon"
4. Check if brand name = company name

**From Website:**
1. Find "About Us" page → Often lists founders/team
2. Find "Contact" page → Sometimes has names
3. Check website footer for company name
4. Look for "Our Story" or "Meet the Team"

### Information to Capture

Create a spreadsheet with these columns:

| Column | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Brand Name | "PureLife Naturals" |
| Amazon Storefront | amazon.com/stores/purelife |
| Website | purelifenaturals.com |
| Company Name | PureLife Wellness LLC |
| Estimated Revenue | $50-100K/mo (based on BSR) |
| Category | Health & Household |
| Decision Maker | John Smith |
| Title | Founder & CEO |
| LinkedIn URL | linkedin.com/in/johnsmith |
| Email (if found) | john@purelifenaturals.com |
| Status | Not contacted |

## STEP 3: FIND THE DECISION MAKER ON LINKEDIN

### LinkedIn Search Strategies

**Search 1: Company Search**
1. Go to LinkedIn
2. Search company name
3. Click on company page
4. Click "People" tab
5. Look for: Founder, CEO, Owner, President, E-commerce Director, Amazon Manager

**Search 2: Direct Title Search**
```
"[Brand Name]" AND (Founder OR CEO OR Owner OR "E-commerce")
```

**Search 3: If No Company Page**
```
"[Brand Name]" Amazon
"[Brand Name]" e-commerce
"[Brand Name]" founder
```

### Who to Target (Priority Order)

1. **Founder / CEO / Owner** — Best. Decision maker.
2. **President / Co-Founder** — Also great.
3. **VP/Director of E-commerce** — Good. Often manages Amazon.
4. **Amazon Manager / E-commerce Manager** — Can refer you up.
5. **Marketing Director** — Sometimes owns Amazon.

### LinkedIn Sales Navigator (Recommended)

**Why It's Worth It:**
- Advanced search filters
- See who's viewed your profile
- InMail credits (message non-connections)
- Save leads and lists
- See when people change jobs

**Sales Navigator Search:**
```
Keywords: Amazon, e-commerce, DTC, consumer products
